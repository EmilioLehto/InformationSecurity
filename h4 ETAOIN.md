Chapter 1 foundations: 
The main function of encryption is to disguise ones plaintext message from eavesdroppers by using cryptography.
 However there is additional functions that are asked other than confidentiality: Authentication, Integrity, Nonrepudiation. 
Authentication: for the receiver of the message to gain knowledge of the origin of said massage. 
Integrity: to have certainty that a message hasn’t been tampered or changed by any third-party.
Nonerepudiation: The sender has digital fingerprint on the message and cant claim that the message wasn’t sent to him. 
A cryptographic or also known as cipher is a mathematical function that is used in enciphering and deciphering. Algorithms differ from degrees of security as they all don’t need to be created equal. A good rule of thumb is that if the value of deciphering the message is larger than the value of the message then the data is most likely safe. 
It used to be so that the algorithm was kept as a secret when sending secret information, but nowadays that would be a naïve method believing that nobody will figure out the algorithm. New methods have come into place like making key.

There exists unique ways to hide the existence of the whole message, steganography, which has been recently used in hiding messages in graphic images. One does this by replacing the least significant elements of the image and adding in it the hidden message.

z) Choose a password manager. Explain:  BitWarden
What threats does it protect against?
Against attackers that want to steal my data by having a keylogger or by knowing a password of my own that gets used frequently in different websites. 

What information is encrypted, what's not?
It encrypts my passwords and private information. Those are the only things that are secured. I can also add credit cards and ID information.

What's the license? How would you describe license's effects or categorize it?
I would be using the free version which has all the basic tools to keep my information secure, if I would decide to get a premium subscription then I would get more two factor authentication and a authenticator key storage and 1GB of encrypted storage space. 

Where is the data stored? If in "the cloud", which country / juristiction / which companies? If on local disk, where?
The data is stored on the cloud in either the EU or US so it is hard to know the juristriction as the information is vague, however bitwarden does not store my passwords as plaintext but it gets encrypted and only my master password can unlock it.
How is the data protected?
By sending it fully encrypted and hashed before it leaves my local device, it also locks my passwords with an end-to-end AES-CBC 256 bit encryption, salt hashing, and PBKDF2 SHA-256. And these keys are all generated by my client and encrypted immediately. 

 a) ETAOIN. When asked to come up with encryption scheme in the class, almost everyone described a variation of a simple substitution chipher. As requested, now it's time to attack your own scheme! Crack this ciphertext:
HDMH'B TH. KWU'YI AWR WSSTOTMJJK M OWQINYIMLIY! MB KWU BII, BTGPJI BUNBHTHUHTWA OTPDIYB OMA NI NYWLIA RTHD SYIEUIAOK MAMJKBTB. BII KWU MH DHHP://HIYWLMYCTAIA.OWG
That’s it you’re now officially a codebreaker! As you see simple substitution ciphers can be broken with frequency analysis. See you at http://terokarvinen.com


b) Demonstrate the use of a password manager

First we have to download the application and register so we can use the application. 


![Screenshot 2023-09-16 193138](https://github.com/EmilioLehto/InformationSecurity/assets/113890358/7a9ef0b9-90e6-47e9-b154-609793eed43c)

We then install it to our desktop 

![Screenshot 2023-09-16 193232](https://github.com/EmilioLehto/InformationSecurity/assets/113890358/e3e57cf8-0b99-499a-bd47-3d23b74cfd46)

Once we open the application we verify our email and then go to the new section to add passwords of applicatios we use frequently. we can also add cards or identity cards.

![Screenshot 2023-09-16 193419](https://github.com/EmilioLehto/InformationSecurity/assets/113890358/cd5bcb1a-16a0-4e6c-86d9-0b9742ac63bf)

In here we add which type this infromation will be (login, card, identity), we add the name of the website, our username of said website and the password we use in it. After that we add the URI and save the changed ones ready. 

![Screenshot 2023-09-16 193616](https://github.com/EmilioLehto/InformationSecurity/assets/113890358/d7581693-3cf9-436c-a7df-cd4936bc7d69)
 Then we are ready and the information is saved and can be used by clicking the link in the information or by just going to the website and this option will be offere. 


 c) Encrypt and decrypt a message. Explain the purpose of each step. Explain why you choose the tool you're using. (You can use any tool you want. You must do and report the encryption at the same time, it's not enough to try to remember what we did in the class. )

I first created the document that I wanted to encrypt. I called it secret.txt

![IMG_9024](https://github.com/EmilioLehto/InformationSecurity/assets/113890358/7f8d7298-b4a5-4097-ae62-0e66cb5df544)
Then I opened up my command line and used the command ls to check if the file is there. 

![IMG_9031](https://github.com/EmilioLehto/InformationSecurity/assets/113890358/ef75578b-999f-4d60-ab35-b55e45acc2c8)
After that I used the command gpg -c secret.txt and it asked me for a password so I added a secure one. The c stands for encrypted. 

![encrypted](https://github.com/EmilioLehto/InformationSecurity/assets/113890358/a7d3feca-fc54-47fe-aac4-79b7726bcb85)
This is how my encrypted file looked afterwards.

![IMG_9036](https://github.com/EmilioLehto/InformationSecurity/assets/113890358/ee999b4c-eb9c-49a6-9cc4-70cd3f410697)
It is important to then remove the original file as the encrypted version is just a copy. the way to the delete it is by going to the command and typing rm secret.txt. If the password is forgotten at this point the data will be impossible to retrieve. 

![IMG_9037](https://github.com/EmilioLehto/InformationSecurity/assets/113890358/c6164dbb-6b9d-4ba5-bc97-fe91f6108f5d)
If want to decrypt it I will use the command gpg -d secret.txt.gpg and this will as me for the password I gave earlier. 

![IMG_9038](https://github.com/EmilioLehto/InformationSecurity/assets/113890358/d4d19360-35a7-426c-bf4c-9bdbb1b959ee)
Now the file is decrypted and can be opened again. 

Encrypting through GPG in Linux felt like it was the best way to encrypt any file one needs in a way thats easy efficient and secure.
