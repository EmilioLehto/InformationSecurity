Introduction:
The Onion Router browser, or also known as Tor is a internet browsing system that revolutionized anonymity in the internet. It combines ease of use with extreme privacy by simply hiding your IP address. 

History and Intended Use of The Onion Router:
Tor was initially created by the US government in 2002, it allowed individuals to connect to the internet anonymously. This allowed individuals to by pass totalitarian government, to whistleblowing, and for journalists to keep safe when sharing information.
The  US government did create Tor but they hold no control over it, to the extent that now they are trying to deanonymize users of it. 

How The Onion Router Works:
The basic concept of how Tor works is that the individuals using the services want to remain completely anonymous. The user will bounce his connection around different nodes while using increasing levels of encryption until it reaches the last node and that node will go to the website that the user will like to go in his behalf. Tor uses three nodes. The clever thing about the onion router is that each node only knows the information it has been given before and after so node number 3 wont know anything about the first node. 

Tracking Criminals Using TOR:
The way Tor works makes it impossible to track an user by breaking the onion router. The best course of action one can take to locate and individual through Tor is by exploiting the individual rather than the technology. 
There are ton of methods to try to exploit your target to reveal his IP address but most methods require extensive time and resources that only a few organizations would have.
