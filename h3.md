 #h3 --Should Tero wear a helmet?

Thread modeling manifesto: 	
	This manifesto is a methodology on how to highlight privacy concerns in any system, that includes big corporations to your own computer. 
Thread modelling allows individuals to recognize gaps in their systems and implementation issues that require analysis so they could be accounted for and fixed, these discoveries are named threats. 
The manifesto doesn’t follow a how to philosophy but it rather contains bigger picture ideas that need to be understood and implemented to the specific system one has. The two main guidelines: values and principles.

Shostack 2022:
-	Thread modelling is a set of methods that allows us to build a system as secure as we want it to be 
-	These are the main four question when thread modelling: What are we working on? What could go wrong? What are we going to do about it? Did we do a good job?
-	Sketching is an important element to know what a team would be working on as it is a tool that is impermanent and can bring new ideas and perspectives.
-	Data flow diagram: external entities, data flows,  data stores, trust boundaries, processes 
-	STRIDE is a method to check if anything in the system can go wrong by testing it out with STRIDE: spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, elevation of privileges.

Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet
Thread modelling is done to identify all potential threats to the systems. All developers should implement threat modelling into their development life cycle to create a safe software. To produce a good threat model one needs a lot of documentation, on  hoe the data flows through a system to identify where the system is being attacked, to document all potential threats and to figure out what sort of security controls will have to be put into place.

a)	Security hygiene:
a.	Have a trusting internet search engine, such as DuckDuckGo instead of google.
b.	Do not join unknown networks in public areas as they might be traps, rather always use your hotspot. 
c.	Do no leave your computer on and unattended when in public settings, if you do then pack your laptop so it cant be grabbed as easily. 
d.	Do not run files that are suspicious before having good knowledge of their origin. 
e.	Use different passwords in different services and make them unrelated to oneself.
f.	This might be above Joe’s knowledge but using a VPN can help with security. 
g.	Encrypt your hard drive 



b) Make-belief boogie-man - a threat model for imaginary company.

VitaBricks is a startup in Helsinki focusing on making easier for their customers to make food at home. The company has created an app which has a massive library of recipes for all levels, it gives instructions on how to cook and also in giving the user information on what ingredients they will require. Vitabricks works closely with all stores in Helsinki to give information to the customers in which store each produce can be gathered, this includes ethnic stores.
The target audience is specifically individuals who struggle to plan and cook meals, it also saves time when going to supermarkets.
The threat modelling team has priorities in keeping the software safe and secure from outside influences furthermore there is an emphasis on keeping the information we gather from the stores to our databases as secure as possible. Another priority is the customer data and information as the company is trying to build trust with the customers and not to scare them away. Vitabricks will be using STRIDE to identify any security threats to the software by breaking the system into components, we want all the developers to be knowledgeable with STRIDE and how it is designed and performed. We want the developers and security experts to focus on areas of the software that have security implications such as the database which holds the information of the customers, and to keep safe the trust boundaries they have with third party stores which give data.
The steps the team has taken to create a successful threat model is by following some steps:
Step 1: Diagramming

This diagram is a basic example of how the system in VitaBricks would work, using two different data bases one for the storage of recopies which are in the application and another one to give the main database information on the ingredients each store has. All the data from the main database which also holds customer information will be copied and placed in a cloud service so that the information can remain safe if an attack is done to the main database. 

Step 2: Threat enumeration
This step in VitaBricks is used to visualize and discuss the different elements that still need to be considered if they have met the requirements of safety.

Step 3: Mitigation
Once step two is done Vitabricks looks at the risks that it has identified and addresses them, by updating code, introducing new security systems or to accept the risk if its not financially logical. 
Step 4: Validation
Lastly VitaBricks sees if the system that they have made accurately reflects what they sought after. If it doesn’t then the team will have to go back to step 2 and discuss what is missing.  

The things that the VitaBricks team thought could go wrong still after having quite a holistic approach is that even though STRIDE covers quite a big area of security it isn’t all equally secure as some area will hold higher importance making some other areas weaker. Furthermore, topics outside the scope of STRIDE have been dismissed and that can cause quite a security threat. 
For example, VitaBricks has decided to prioritize the most in high value gaps and also the ones that have the highest probability of happening.  An example below on how that information is gathered: Result = probability * monetary value.

	Probability	Monetary value	Result
Server gets slowed by DDoS attack 	10%	100 euro	10 euro
Customer information gets leaked and sold	1 % 	100000 euro	1000 euro

Is VitaBricks targeted by specific threat actors?  It is easy to say that at the stage that VitaBricks is at there doesn’t seem to be any possible threat actors other than petty hacking criminals and thrill seekers which have been in the decline. In regards of the networks safety against TTP threat actors is that we seek to keep our network strong as possible against infiltration to our network so they don’t establish any footing in the control center. However malware is probably something that can enter our system quite easily if not taking precautions and the system would also be weak to mistakes made in the code like and injection or something more simple like a DDOS attack. However we lack to see any intent at this point of the company as it is a start up which would only have small profit margin to attack. 

What are we going to do about it? 
It is clear that  VitaBricks cannot protect everything equally and the budget isn’t the highest as it is a start up, however prevention plans can be put into place to minimize or eve mitigate big monetary damage. One would be to conduct regular vulnerability assessments, to keep all systems up to date, to establish a protocol with clear communication if a threat actor is spotted and to conduct regular vulnerability assessments.

Did we do a good enough job? 
This is when the team can look at Step 2: enumeration. Discuss if the system that has been created reflects the system that is wanted. At the moment the system in place is in its developmental stage and things will improve from here forward by reflecting on errors, assessing mistakes and penetration testing the system for any further vulnerabilities
